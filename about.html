              <div>Real-time strategy (RTS) is a sub-genre of strategy video games in which the game does not progress 
                  incrementally in turns. This is distinguished from turn-based strategy (TBS), in which all players 
                  take turns when playing.</div>

                      largely between amateurs until the late 2000s, when participation by professional gamers and spectatorship 
                      in these events through live streaming saw a large surge in popularity.By the 2010s, esports was a 
                      significant factor in the video game industry, with many game developers actively designing toward a 
                      professional esports subculture.</div>
